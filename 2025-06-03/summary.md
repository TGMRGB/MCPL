|        05-31       | - Started Project. Created base files `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. Laid down basic HTML and CSS for index. - Created page `interests.html`. Created basic HTML/CSS for the page. Added colour-changing JavaScript for `interests.html`. |   |   |   |
|        06-02       | - Refined CSS for `index.html`. Refined `interests.html`  to use an accordion list. Added JS interaction to `index.html`. Finished both pages. - Added webpages `schedule.html` and `others.html`. Placed todo messages in both.                        |   |   |   |
|        06-03       | - Finished `schedule.html` by adding a schedule table. - Finished `others.html` by adding a nonfunctional feedback form. The form will not work without a backend, however that is a concern for another week. Polished website's CSS and JS.           |   |   |   |

**Summary:**  
This problem is one of the most open-ended problems I have ever encountered. For most of these problems, there exists a program called [`check50`](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/fp252-sharpA.pdf), which evaluates student code for correctness. However, this tool is not present for any of the H/C/J problemsets. Because of this, the methods of solving the problem become even more open-ended than what is usually expected of software development. For this problem, the homepage must follow certain criteria displayed in the specificiation. It was a challenge to meet these goals, although in the later days of development I found myself exceeding the goals of the specification. 

**Challenges:**
This problem is highly open-ended. I find that when pertaining to open-ended questions, the most difficult part is to start. After a general vision of the website is acquired through half an hour of experimentation, the goals I wish to accomplish become easier to realize. However, I did not find much issue with the coding and programming aspects of this problem. This problem focuses on the frontend of a website, and is used solely for "making the website *look* pretty". Therefore, the HTML used for this problem could be sourced from front-end frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), especially when the problem encourages doing so in the specification. Furthermore, HTML and CSS are mainly key/tag dependant. In other words, these languages rely more on memorizing vocabulary than syntax(Both HTML and CSS are very relaxed with syntax, especially spacing-related formatting.).

**Specification:**  
`For this problem, equally as important as solving the mystery itself is the process that you use to solve the mystery. In log.sql, keep a log of all SQL queries that you run on the database. Above each query, label each with a comment (in SQL, comments are any lines that begin with --) describing why youâ€™re running the query and/or what information youâ€™re hoping to get out of that particular query. You can use comments in the log file to add additional notes about your thought process as you solve the mystery: ultimately, this file should serve as evidence of the process you used to identify the thief!`

`As you write your queries, you may notice that some of them can become quite complex. To help keep your queries readable, see principles of good style at sqlstyle.guide. The indentation section may be particularly helpful!`

`Once you solve the mystery, complete each of the lines in answers.txt by filling in the name of the thief, the city that the thief escaped to, and the name of the thiefâ€™s accomplice who helped them escape town. (Be sure not to change any of the existing text in the file or to add any other lines to the file!)`

`Ultimately, you should submit both your log.sql and answers.txt files.`

## Week 7 Complete ðŸŽ‰
Week 7, SQL, is officially finished. By `Wednesday, May 28`, I will be working on "Week 8 (Each unit is named "Week", as each unit is designed to be completed in one week. I am on an accelerated schedule.) : **HTML/CSS/JS**.
