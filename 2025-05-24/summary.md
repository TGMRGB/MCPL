There is a second unforseen delay, as my course has been forced to be canceled a second time in a row. For this reason, the work of my project has been delayed  
by one week, as I possess no other method of learning. However, my course is guaranteed to continue on `2025-05-28`. The third problem will be completed accordingly.
