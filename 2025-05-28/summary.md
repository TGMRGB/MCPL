# Capstone Progress Report: 2025-05-17

## Concepts Learned:
* Basic Syntax of HTML, CSS, and JS.
* The use cases of HTML/CSS/JS *(hereby referred to as HCJ for simplicity)*
* The concept of transferring data through the internet
* Internet protocol concepts and usages, including but not limited to:
    - `DNS`
    - `HTTPS`
    - `DCHP`
    - `TCP/IP`
* Basic operational functions of HTML. To demonstrate this, I will format the rest of the document using HTML syntax.

<h2>Tasks Completed: </h2>
 <li> Took a 2-hour lesson/reflection about week 7 and learned the basics of HCJ
 <li> Finished problem 1 in problem set 8: <b>Trivia</b>.

<h2>Problem 1: Trivia</h2>
 <b>Write a webpage that lets users answer trivia questions.</b>

 <hr>

 <b>Summary:</b>
This problem involves taking <u>Distribution Code</u> from CS50's staff containing a barebones website, and then implementing some trivia questions using event listeners and forms/buttons. The problem requires one MCQ(Multiple-Choice Question) and one FRQ(Free-Response Question).

**Specification:**

1. In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

2. In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

3. In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

4. In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

5. In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.

6. In 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
    * You should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone's artist_id is.
