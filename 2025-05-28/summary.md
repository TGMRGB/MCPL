# Capstone Progress Report: 2025-05-17

## Concepts Learned:
* Basic Syntax of HTML, CSS, and JS.
* The use cases of HTML/CSS/JS *(hereby referred to as H/C/J for simplicity)*
* The concept of transferring data through the internet
* Internet protocol concepts and usages, including but not limited to:
    - `DNS`
    - `HTTPS`
    - `DCHP`
    - `TCP/IP`
* Basic operational functions of HTML. To demonstrate this, I will format the rest of the document using HTML syntax. 
    <h6>NOTE: This change in syntax can be seen by directly viewing the code for this markdown file.

<h2>Tasks Completed: </h2>
 <li> Took a 2-hour lesson/reflection about week 7 and learned the basics of H/C/J/
 <li> Finished problem 1 in problem set 8: <b>Trivia</b>.

<h2>Problem 1: Trivia</h2>
 <b>Task: Write a webpage that lets users answer trivia questions.</b> <br>

 <hr> 

 <b>Summary:</b>
This problem involves taking <u>Distribution Code</u> from CS50's staff containing a barebones website, and then implementing some trivia questions using event listeners and forms/buttons. The problem requires one MCQ(Multiple-Choice Question) and one FRQ(Free-Response Question). I used basic HTML form syntax to create the questions, and then used javascript to implement the event listeners. <br>
<b>Challenges:</b>
As I have had zero exposure to H/C/J before, I started with no knowledge of how to accomplish anything. Solving this problem required me to partially look at the answer, as well as comb the documentation for H/C/J to properly implement my goals. However, this problem has successfully taught me the basics of H/C/J, and the second problem should be less of a challenge.

## Capstone Status:
- [x] Problem 1  
- [ ] Problem 2  
- [ ] Problem 3  
My schedule is progressing as planned. I am set to complete the rest of the problem set before `2025-05-21`, my next reflection date.  
My next status report is slated to be complete before that date.
