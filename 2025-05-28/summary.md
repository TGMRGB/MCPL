# Capstone Progress Report: 2025-05-17

## Concepts Learned:
* Basic Syntax of HTML, CSS, and JS.
* The use cases of HTML/CSS/JS *(hereby referred to as H/C/J for simplicity)*
* The concept of transferring data through the internet
* Internet protocol concepts and usages, including but not limited to:
    - `DNS`
    - `HTTPS`
    - `DCHP`
    - `TCP/IP`
* Basic operational functions of HTML. To demonstrate this, I will format the rest of the document using HTML syntax. 
    <h6>NOTE: This change in syntax can be seen by directly viewing the code for this markdown file.

<h2>Tasks Completed: </h2>
 <li> Took a 2-hour lesson/reflection about week 7 and learned the basics of H/C/J/
 <li> Finished problem 1 in problem set 8: <b>Trivia</b>.

<h2>Problem 1: Trivia</h2>
 <b>Task: Write a webpage that lets users answer trivia questions.</b> <br>

 <hr> 

 <b>Summary:</b>
This problem involves taking <u>Distribution Code</u> from CS50's staff containing a barebones website, and then implementing some trivia questions using event listeners and forms/buttons. The problem requires one MCQ(Multiple-Choice Question) and one FRQ(Free-Response Question). I used basic HTML form syntax to create the questions, and then used javascript to implement the event listeners. <br>
<b>Challenges:</b>
As I have had zero exposure to H/C/J before, I started with no knowledge of how to accomplish anything. Solving this problem required me to partially look at the answer, as well as comb the documentation for H/C/J to properly implement my goals. However, this problem has successfully taught me the basics of H/C/J, and the second problem should be less of a challenge.

<b>Specification:</b> <br>
<code>
Design a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to let users answer trivia questions.
<ul>
<li>In index.html, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with HTML.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.</li>
    <li>You should have one button for each of the possible answer choices. There should be at least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Using JavaScript, add logic so that the buttons change colors when a user clicks on them.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>If a user clicks on a button with an incorrect answer, the button should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.</li>
    <li>If a user clicks on a button with the correct answer, the button should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.</li>
    </ul>
<li>In index.html, add beneath “Part 2” a text-based free response question of your choosing with HTML.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.</li>
    <li>You should use an input field to let the user type a response.</li>
    <li>You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Using JavaScript, add logic so that the text field changes color when a user confirms their answer.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>If the user types an incorrect answer and presses the confirmation button, the text field should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.</li>
    <li>If the user types the correct answer and presses the confirmation button, the input field should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
Optionally, you may also:
<ul>
<li>Edit styles.css to change the CSS of your webpage!</li>
<li>Add additional trivia questions to your trivia quiz if you would like!</li>
</ul>

## Capstone Status:
- [x] Problem 1 
- [ ] Problem 2   
My schedule is progressing as expected. However, I am unsure as to if I am able to finish problem 2 before <code>2025-05-31</code>. If not, I will be finished Problem 2 by <code>2025-06-02</code>, at the very latest.
