# Capstone Progress Report: 2025-05-17

## Concepts Learned:
 * Basic SQL Query Syntax (Commands such as SELECT, ORDER BY, DROP, etc) and SQL language syntax (e.g. formatting syntax)
 * SQL terms such as:  
    `Tables`  
    `Types`  
    `Statements`  
    `Constraints`  
    `Indexes`  
    `Keywords`  
    `Functions`  
    `Transactions`  
 * Vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks

 ## Tasks Completed:
 * Watched a lecture on the above topics (runtime 2:37:48)
 * Started Problem Set 7 and completed Problem 1: Songs

 ## Problem 1: Songs
 **The Task: Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of the 100 most-streamed songs on Spotify in 2018.**  

 ---

 **Summary:**  
 The problem set requests the writing of multiple SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data  
 from one or more of the tables in the provided database, then reflecting on the ways Spotify might use this same data in their  
 annual [Spotify Wrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify_Wrapped)campaign to characterize listeners’ habits.  
  
For each of the 8 available problems, I wrote a single SQL query query that outputs the results specified by each problem, labeling them  
by their corresponding problem number. For example, the first problem was saved in a file called `1.sql`.  
The database I am manipulating has been provided by CS50's staff, and this problem involves adding to distribution code.  
  
**Here are the prompts for each question:**  

---

1. In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

2. In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

3. In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

4. In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

5. In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.

6. In 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
    * You should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone’s artist_id is.

7. In 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of songs that are by Drake.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.
    * You should not make any assumptions about what Drake’s artist_id is.

8. In 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of the songs that feature other artists.
    * Songs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.
    * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.

## Capstone Status:
- [x] Problem 1  
- [ ] Problem 2  
- [ ] Problem 3  
My schedule is progressing as planned. I am set to complete the rest of the problem set before `2025-05-21`, my next reflection date.  
My next status report is slated to be complete before that date.
