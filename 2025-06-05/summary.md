Aside from previous delays, my schedule is proceeding surprisingly well. I am on course to completing the first problem set by `Tomorrow, 2025-06-05`, and am on track to completing the second problem set by `2025-06-09`. This is, of course, slightly behind schedule, and I may have to balance my presentation creation with my final project creation.
