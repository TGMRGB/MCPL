# Capstone Progress Report: 2025-06-04

## Concepts Learned:

`No new concepts learned. This is a progress update log.`

## Tasks Completed:
* Finished watching Lecture 9
* Finished Problem 1: Birthdays
* Started work on Problem 2: Finance


## Problem 1: Birthdays
<strong>The Prompt and Specification for <em>Birthdays</em> can be found <a href="../2025-06-04/summary.md">here<a>.</strong>


**Summary:**  
This is a continuation of the work completed on    `2025-06-04`. I finished the problem according to the specification found above, and included the bonus feature `Delete Birthday Entries`.

**Challenges:** <br>
`none`. This problem can be considered quite trivial if Lecture 9 was watched. 

**The finished code can be found in this directory's subfolder. Peruse at one's own leisure.**

## Capstone Status:
- [x] Problem 1  
- [ ] Problem 2   

Aside from previous delays, my schedule is proceeding surprisingly well. I am on course to completing the first problem set by `Tomorrow, 2025-06-05`, and am on track to completing the second problem set by `2025-06-09`. This is, of course, slightly behind schedule, and I may have to balance my presentation creation with my final project creation.
