/* THE INFO RECOVERED FROM THE INTERVIEWS:
| 161 | Ruth    | 2024 | 7     | 28  | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car
in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want
 to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

| 162 | Eugene  | 2024 | 7     | 28  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street
and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

| 163 | Raymond | 2024 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

THE CLUES SO FAR:
1. The thief left the scene somewhere between 10:15 and 10:25.
2. Before 10:15, the thief withdrew some money fron an atm on Leggett Street.
3. Sometime between 10:15 and 10:25, a call was made for the earliest flight departing from Fiftyville on 2024-07-29
